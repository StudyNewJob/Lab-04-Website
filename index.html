        <h2>But Why Star Wars?</h2>
        <p>
            Star Wars actually holds a special place in my heart and my entire family. My grand-mother and step grand-father had their first date watching the
            premiers of episode 6, A New Hope in 1977. I've read many of the Star Wars books and obviously have seen all the movies. It's my favorite IP!
